# Crypto Analysis

This little project was created to demonstrate how to perform an analysis of a crypto time series using Python, Statistics and Machine Learning techniques for strategy optimization. The project is divided into 2 parts, one for data scraping and another for the analysis of the extracted data.

## Table of contents
* [Data Scraping](#data-scraping)
* [Data Analysis](#data-analysis)

## Data Scraping
Using the **Bybit API** and the [**pybit module**](https://pypi.org/project/pybit/) you can extract all the historical data of the selected pair, from the moment it was listed on the exchange until today, you can also choose the _extraction timeframe_. We will be able to do this important task with **_crypto_scraper.py_** file and you can see an application example in the **_example.py_** file (both the files are in the Scraping folder).

An example of data extraction:
```
import crypto_scraper as cs

bybit_scr = cs.ByBit_Scraper(bybit_session)
bybit_scr.extract_history("BTCUSDT", 15)
```
## Data Analysis
After extracting the data I analyzed the BTCUSDT time serie to try to identify a good strategy. I followed these steps:

- Importing all the modules needed
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Adding Indicators (SMAs and EMAs)
- Analyzing the position of the candles to identify possible patterns
- Strategy Backtesting
- Machine Learning Implementation for Strategy Optimization
- Conclusion

To see how the analysis turned out take a look at the result ðŸ˜‰
